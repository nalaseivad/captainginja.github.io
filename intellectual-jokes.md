# Intellectual Jokes

As well as being a huge fan of ["crap jokes"]({{ site.baseurl }}crap-jokes) I'm also rather partial to "intellectual
jokes", i.e. those that require a certain esoteric knowledge to get.  Here's a selection.

He said to the waiter, "I'll have coffee with sugar but no milk".

Erwin Schrodinger and Werner Heisenberg were out driving together one day and
got pulled over by the cops.  The police officer walked up to the driver's side
window and motioned for Heisenberg - who was driving - to roll it down.  Werner

the physicist with a twinkle in his eye, "But I know exactly where I was".

"Alright wiseguy, out of the car", the cop replied and the two scientists got
out.  "Open the trunk for me please", instructed the cop.  Werner popped the
lock and stepped back for the officer to take a look.

emanated from inside.  "Do you know you've got a dead cat in here?"

"I do now!" Schrodinger exclaimed.
