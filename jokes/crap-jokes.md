# Crap Jokes

I am a huge fan of "crap jokes", i.e. jokes that are so bad they are actually good; the kind that make you groan but
also make you smile.  In America these are generally known as "Dad jokes" but I don't see why fathers should have a
monopoly on them.  Anyone can tell them, what matters is that they are crap.

Here's a selection.  Be warned, some of these are not in the best possible taste, but they're still funny.
