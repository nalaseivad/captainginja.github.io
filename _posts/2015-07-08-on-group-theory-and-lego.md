Another [video post](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmMuUVCLtkg)!  This time involving a Rubik's Cube and a bunch of
LEGO<sup>&#174;</sup>.  By the way, anyone who says
[Legos]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2015-07-08-on-how-legos-is-wrong %}) should be taken out back and shot.  Only
Americans say Legos and they are wrong, about many things.  Although they are right about some things too; but that,
dear reader, is a post for another day.
