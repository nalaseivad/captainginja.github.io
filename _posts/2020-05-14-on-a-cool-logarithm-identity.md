What is the value of this sum?

$$\frac{1}{log_{2}(100!)} + \frac{1}{log_{3}(100!)} + \frac{1}{log_{4}(100!)} + \ldots + \frac{1}{log_{100}(100!)}$$

Well, it turns out that the answer is just $$1$$.  Isn't that cool.  Let's prove it.

# Prep

Let's recall some basic logarithmic identitities.  First the relationship between logs of different bases ...

$$\log_{b}(a) = \frac{log_{c}(a)}{\log_{c}{b}}$$

And then the relationship between the log of the product of two numbers and the logs of those numbers ...

$$\log(ab) = \log(a) + \log(b)$$

# Proof

We are asked to show that ...

$$\frac{1}{log_{2}(100!)} + \frac{1}{log_{3}(100!)} + \frac{1}{log_{4}(100!)} + \ldots + \frac{1}{log_{100}(100!)} = 1$$

We know that ...

$$\log_{b}(a) = \frac{log_{c}(a)}{\log_{c}{b}}$$

So ...

$$\log_{2}(100!) = \frac{log(100!)}{\log{2}}$$

Where $$log$$ here represents log to the base $$e$$.

Therefore ...

$$\frac{1}{\log_{2}(100!)} = \frac{\log{2}}{log(100!)}$$

Similarly ...

$$\frac{1}{\log_{3}(100!)} = \frac{\log{3}}{log(100!)}$$

$$\frac{1}{\log_{4}(100!)} = \frac{\log{4}}{log(100!)}$$

$$\dots$$

$$\frac{1}{\log_{100}(100!)} = \frac{\log{100}}{log(100!)}$$

So the left hand side of the original expression is ...

$$\frac{log(2) + log(3) + log(4) + \ldots + \log(100)}{log(100!)}$$

We also know that ...

$$\log(a) + \log(b) = \log(ab)$$

So ...

$$log(2) + log(3) + log(4) + \ldots + \log(100) = \log(2 \cdot 3 \cdot 4 \cdot \ldots \cdot 100) = \log(100!)$$

Plugging this back into the left hand side of the original expression we get ...

$$\frac{\log(100!)}{\log(100!)}$$

Which is equal to $$1$$.  Therefore ...

$$\frac{1}{log_{2}(100!)} + \frac{1}{log_{3}(100!)} + \frac{1}{log_{4}(100!)} + \ldots + \frac{1}{log_{100}(100!)} = 1$$
