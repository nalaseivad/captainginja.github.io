I've written about about this [before]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-11-18-on-getting-back-on-the-horse %}) but it
seems that I need to write about it again.  It takes discipline to keep up a blog and clearly I don't have any.  I could
blame COVID but given all that time in lockdown one would imagine that I would have had "more" time to write.  I guess I
got too used to binge watching shows on streaming services and drinking.  Sigh.

OK, let's get this thing started up again.  I've got a bunch of topics in mind to write about, and I'll try not to get
distracted by anything; like my long put off project to build a big wooden badger ...
